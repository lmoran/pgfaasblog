# Introducing pgFaaS


pgFaaS, simply put, is *PostGresql Functions As A Service*

At the current stage is more of a proof-of-concept than a polished product, but it is stanle enought to be used in production, 
albeit with rough edges when it comes to debugging (error messages are still difficult to understand). 


## What is it for?

Deploy Node.js scripts (but it could be extended to )

## Why should I use it?

If you, like me, want developers to add geo-processing to their applications on data you host  


## How does it work?


## How a script looks like?


## Who is behind it?

The [AURIN project](https://aurin.org.au) is a government-backed organization that provides data and analytical tools to urban researchers.


## Kudos
